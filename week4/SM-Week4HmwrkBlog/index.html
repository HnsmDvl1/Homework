        <h2>Beginners to canvas painting</h2>
        <p>1. Angle Your Canvas To Paint Comfortably<br />
    First, decide whether you’ll be seated or standing when you paint. Many easels are easy to adjust so you can switch between both. Adjust your easel based on your height and how comfortable it is to hold the brush up to the canvas. For some painting techniques, you want to be able to make contact with the canvas at a 90-degree angle.<br /> 
    <br />
    Make sure you can easily see your painting subject, whether it’s a video tutorial, a drawing, or a real-life object.<br />
    <br />
    2. Take Advantage of Canvas Wedges<br />
    If you received a little packet of wood or plastic pieces with your store-bought canvas, they’re called canvas wedges, canvas tightening keys, or stretcher bar keys. They’re used to stretch and tighten the canvas if it starts to sag.<br /> 
    <br />
    Canvas can get droopy from all the layers of wet paint, temperature changes, humidity, and age. If you notice sagginess after painting, wait until your canvas is completely dry and hammer the wedges in afterward.<br /> 
    <br />
    3. Sketch Your Image or Underpaint<br />
    You know the saying, “Measure twice, cut once?” Set yourself up for success by sketching your image before you start laying down paint. Grab a pencil, color pencil, or charcoal and make a sketch on a piece of paper.<br /> 
    <br />
    This is a helpful tip for any painting, but here’s the great thing about canvas: You can use a pencil (graphite) to lightly outline your art on the canvas and then paint over it. Another technique is to do an “underpainting” or “wash,” which is when you use very watered down paint to make a rough sketch.<br /> 
    <br />
    Both tips give you more control over the final image. You can simply follow the lines as you go and you know it’ll be closer to what you want (compared to a freehanded attempt).<br />
    <br />
    4. Lay Out Your Supplies Before You Get Started<br />
    The last thing you want is to be running around trying to find a Round 6 brush or more paper towels while you’re in the creative zone. Once you start painting, you want everything you need within arms’ reach so that you don’t lose inspiration or have your paint dry too much while you’re hunting for supplies.<br /> 
    <br />
    Gather up your brushes, necessary paint colors (black, white, red, blue, and yellow are usually the minimum), paint palette, a cup of water, paper towels, and anything else you think you’re going to need.</p>

        <h2>Intermediate brushstrokers</h2>
        <p>5. Use Paintbrushes With Firm, Tough Bristles<br />
    The paint brushes you choose have to be able to withstand the hard, rough canvas surface. So, look for brushes with stiff bristles that are graded for acrylic and oil painting.<br /> 
    <br />
    Avoid grabbing any watercolor brushes you have lying around — they’re known for being softer and are going to break down rather quickly when used on canvas. A bonus to using firm-bristle brushes? They make it easier to do unique acrylic painting techniques like dry brushstrokes.<br /> 
    <br />
    6. Start With a Toned Canvas To Add a Unique Quality<br />
    Who says you have to start your painting on a plain white canvas? Try a toned background: Simply choose an interesting color, paint the canvas, let it dry, and then start on your artwork. It can make colors pop and enhance the painting’s luminosity.<br />  
    <br />
    For example, if you’re going to paint a lovely blue sky, you could start out by painting the canvas with a bright yellow. It may seem scary, but the yellow undertone could add a sunlit warmth to everything in your painting.<br /> 
    <br />
    The fun is in experimenting with different colors to see what effect it has. Check out color wheels and color theory to get some ideas.<br />
    <br />
    7. Get Creative With Solvents and Mediums<br />
    Canvas is extremely durable, which means you can use a wide variety of mediums (products that can thicken and change the texture of paint) and solvents (products that thin paint out and clean paint brushes) to have fun with the look of your artwork.<br />
    <br />
    When it comes to acrylic paint, you’re likely going to use water as your solvent. You can apply different mediums to make your painting look glossy, matte, transparent, 3D, and more. These tools give you the freedom to experiment and see what you come up with.<br />

        <p>8. Easily Erase Mistakes With Water, Titanium White, or Sandpaper
    Painter Bob Ross once said, “We don’t make mistakes, just happy little accidents.” So, if your canvas experiences a “happy little accident,” don’t worry. You can use water, titanium white paint, or sandpaper to fix painting mistakes fairly easily.<br /> 
    <br />
    If your painting is still wet: Try scraping off the unwanted paint with your palette knife or something with a sharp edge. Apply some water (or linseed oil for oil paints), wipe the rest away, and paint over with titanium white. Let it dry and then keep painting.<br />
    If your painting is dry: Use fine sandpaper to gently grind down the area with unwanted paint. Use a damp towel with water (for acrylics) or linseed oil (for oils) to clean the area and paint over with titanium white. Let it dry and then keep painting.<br />
    <br />
    9. Choose a Safe Place To Dry and Store Your Canvas When You’re Done
    The last thing that you want is for your new painting to get ruined while it dries! Find a location for the canvas to dry out of harm’s way, away from any water sources, heat sources, small children, or curious pets.<br /> 
    <br />
